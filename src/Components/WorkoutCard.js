                    Ever since I started working out properly (Summer '22), I have been
                    keeping a dutiful log of all my workouts (using the iPhone Notes app ðŸ¤“).
                    This log is automatically synced to the Notes app on my MacBook and will
                    (hopefully) be updated daily.
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>
                    The data flow for this looks something like this.
                    Update log on iPhone - Sync Notes App on MacBook - Run script to extract note and upload to Github as txt.
                </Typography>
                <Typography sx={{ fontStyle: "italic" }} variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>
                    PS: I have found that tracking your workouts is not only a good way to track your
                    progress at the gym but is also a good intrinsic motivator to workout - you want
                    to see your log grow!
